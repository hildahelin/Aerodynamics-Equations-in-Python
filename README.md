## üõ´ Description
This project is a simple Jupyter Notebook to calculate lift and drag forces using standard aerodynamic equations.  
It includes coefficient-based calculations and examples for both Euler and Navier‚ÄìStokes logic.

## üßÆ What‚Äôs Inside?
- ‚úÖ Lift and Drag force calculator
- ‚úÖ Euler-based CL/CD estimation (pressure-only)
- ‚úÖ Navier‚ÄìStokes CL/CD estimation (with shear stress)
- ‚úÖ Fully editable, runnable in Google Colab
